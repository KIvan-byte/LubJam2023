# LubJam2023
The GGJ is the world's largest game creation event taking place around the globe boasting tens of thousands of participants (jammers) at hundreds of physical and virtual sites in over one hundred countries around the world. In January 2020, we had a record-breaking year with 934 locations in 118 countries create 9,601 games in one weekend! In January 2021 we shifted GGJ to an online-only format due to the global pandemic and still hosted a great event with 585 virtual locations in 104 countries which made 6,383 games! In 2022 we welcomed back in-person sites while keeping the option for virtual sites we had over 33,000 jammers register at 681 sites in 100 countries.

A game jam is similar to a hackathon where people come together for a short period of time to create games around a central theme revealed at the start of the jam. The structure of The GGJ is usually that everyone gathers on Friday late afternoon, watches a short video keynote with advice from leading game developers, and then a secret theme is announced. All jammers worldwide are then challenged to make games based on that same theme, with games to be completed by Sunday afternoon.
